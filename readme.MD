# This is a demo project to provide an end-to-end Data & AI Project using Microsoft Fabric

1. You need a Microsoft Fabric trial subscription at the minimum to perform most of the tasks .
2. For AI tasks you will need an Azure Account 
3. You will also need a Finnhub API Key  from <href>https://finnhub.io/<href> for extracting raw data that I am using here. Alternatively I have also uploaded the raw data folder which you can use and skip this part.
