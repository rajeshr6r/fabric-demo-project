And when I look at the next step, the use cases, Palantir, I think, is going to really be the one that's front and center in a lot of these deals,\" Ives argues, calling the company the \"Messi of AI.\" He points to IP (intellectual property) conversion as a major growth area alongside its commercial and government businesses. He adds, \"I don't know how you could have a basket of AI stocks and just dismiss Palantir.\" Broadening the conversation, Ives expects a \"massive tech earnings season\" for semiconductors: \"There's no denying this AI revolution is probably the biggest tech trend we've seen in the last 40, 50 years.\" Apple (AAPL) is the latest player to enter the AI game, announcing its plans to integrate OpenAI's large-language model into its platforms.
