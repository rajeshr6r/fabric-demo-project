New home sales for the month of May fell over 11%, according to the US Census Bureau. KPMG senior economist Yelena Maleyev claims that it will be a while before the housing sector sees relief, only estimating one interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve by December: \"We've pushed that forecast out into December, so we do expect one rate cut in December, which will help bring overall mortgage rates to perhaps around 6.5 by the end of the year. That's probably not what people who are waiting for those 3% mortgage rates are wanting to hear, but unfortunately, those days are behind us.\" She adds that a few more rate cuts in the pipeline could bring mortgage rates to 5.5%. US equity markets have hit record highs in 2024, largely spearheaded by the growth of semiconductor and chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). BlackRock US Head of Thematic and Active ETFs Jay Jacobs sits down with Brad Smith on Wealth! as part of Yahoo Finance's ETF Report to discuss several of BlackRock's notable iShares ETFs in relation to the growing AI landscape and the energy and digital infrastructure demands that come with mass adoption. The number of US households with direct stock ownership increased by 6% between 2019 and 2022, according to a Federal Reserve study of consumer finances. JPMorgan Wealth Management head of self-directed investing Andrea Finan says her biggest tip for beginner investors is to \"find the experts ... Go to credentialized places to get information and learn. I really strive for people to become curious in investing and learn and use the tools...\" Finally, as more than 24 million people are expected to fly out of US airports during the 4th of July weekend, Hopper Lead Economist Hayley Berg gives an overview of thee busy weekend ahead. She explains that summer travel prices have decreased, as airfares are down 18% in the US and hotel and rental car prices remain in line with previous years: \"So those travelers who are getting away are definitely able to expand those travel budgets into things like activities and maybe some nice dinners out rather than spending as much on accommodations and flights.\" This post was written by Melanie Riehl", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=526b98c68375057d5752e9585468c8cbc598bb2cd5a3048cbc07c798d9425675"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1719421500, "headline": "This Week in AI: The fate of generative AI is in the courts' hands", "id": 128483982, "image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/GettyImages-1224612965.jpg?resize=1200,842", "related": "GOOG", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Hiya, folks, and welcome to TechCrunch\u2019s regular AI newsletter.
