Antoine Chkaiban, New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst tells Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to break down why he\u2019s concerned about the iPhone maker in the near term despite expecting the company to be a major benefactor of artificial intelligence (AI). \u201cWe're concerned about the upcoming cycle for a number of reasons,\u201d Chkaiban says. \u201cThere are early data points suggesting that iPhone 16 reception is poor. Users are often disappointed. They see limited innovation. He adds that Apple Intelligence being delayed until after the initial launch of the device \u201cdoesn't really help.\u201d Among the other factors contributing to Apple\u2019s near-term headwinds are shortening refresh cycles as \u201ciPhone users hold onto their devices for longer\u201d and increased competition in China. Another concern is a general weakness in consumer demand. Chkaiban projects Apple will ship 215 million iPhones in fiscal 2025, which is 10% below consensus estimates. Despite near-term concerns, the analyst says Apple is in a prime position in the AI era. He explains, \u201cThe generative AI iPhone revolution indeed won't be hardware-driven. It will happen over multiple cycles. It won't create a near-term product cycle, but it will still revolutionize the user experience over time and I do believe that Apple is very well positioned to capture some value as they control a large ecosystem of high-end devices.\u201d \u201cOver coming years, I think Apple can do well with generative AI, with Apple intelligence getting rolled out. But it's not going to drive a near-term product cycle. That's what we're concerned about.\u201d He expects that Apple\u2019s revenue will grow, but this growth will be driven by services rather than device sales. \u201cBottom line is Apple can probably grow revenues mid to high single digits and earnings between low-to-mid teens. And so yes, over the long run, I think Apple is definitely a good name to own. And if there is indeed a pullback related to weakness in the current cycle, that would probably create a good entry point.\u201d For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Summit Place Financial Advisors founder and president Liz Miller joins Wealth! to break down how investors can best position their portfolios in a lower-rate environment. \"So far this year, we saw the early part of the year really led by, we know, the mega-cap techs and they've held up fine. But what we're going to see now, and we've even started to see in the last week or two, is that some of these other sectors that are more interest-rate sensitive are going to start doing better, like housing and rentals (XLRE) and financials (XLF) and consumer goods (XLP, XLY) that really were struggling in the market the first part of this year,\" Miller tells Yahoo Finance. With the S&P 500 (^GSPC) at all-time highs, Miller notes that it is largely skewed by mega-cap tech stocks. \"When we look at other sectors, they aren't making all-time highs. And our last high in the market was really December 2021,\" she adds. Thus, she believes that there is a lot of upside in the index as the Federal Reserve continues to cut lower interest rates. As China looks to recover its weak economy through a series of stimulus measures, Miller expects the nation's growth to impact US investments: \"What's really needed is to get consumers in China to regain their confidence and start spending again. We look at luxury goods as sort of one of the easy views on what's China spending. We own a lot of multinationals, from Apple (AAPL) to Nike (NKE), that all do better when China is doing better. So we see this in small ways in a lot of US investments too.\" Miller views Nike as one of her top retail picks following the leadership shake-up. She calls the company \"one of the most valuable brands in the world,\" and with the stock's decline over the last few years, investors can get it at a discount. She expects to see a \"turnaround story\" in Nike's fundamentals, and hopes to see new leadership return the company to its competitive position.
