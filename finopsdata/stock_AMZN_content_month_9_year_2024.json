This deal could see the reopening of the Three Mile Island nuclear plant, and according to Jeffries, Microsoft could be paying $112 per megawatt hour, one of the higher estimates across the Street. Jefferies analyst Paul Zimbardo joins Catalysts to discuss the deal between Constellation Energy and Microsoft, and whether the presidential election could weigh on its completion. \"It was a very positive update for Constellation. The struggle on the stock is it's pricing in a lot. When we go through plant by plant, the fundamentals, the market is assuming that roughly 50% are a little bit more than 50% of their portfolio will contract at these very high prices... the $100+ per megawatt hour. So expectations are very high,\" Zimbardo says of the news. Despite regulatory hurdles ahead, if the plan goes through, Zimbardo explains it could be a \"game changer\" for both Constellation and the broader energy sector. \"Microsoft is paying roughly double what market power costs, around $55 a megawatt hour. So this was a significant update, paying a much larger premium than even the prior transaction with Amazon (AMZN) and a different nuclear reactor, Susquehanna, owned by Talen (TLN),\" he explains. Zimbardo adds, \"So the way we frame it, if, as we call it, Constellation runs the table and is able to secure all their capacity, our upside case, the stock can easily double from here. But there's a lot of questions and execution that has to go in it.\" As the presidential election lies just over a month away, he does not expect the outcome to weigh too much on the deal. He notes that Constellation is the largest US nuclear owner-operator and they have a good track record both operationally and financially. \"They've been working on this project for over a year, so we feel pretty comfortable that they will be able to execute on this,\" he adds. Zimbaro concludes, \"Nuclear has become increasingly bipartisan, clean energy as well as the strong union jobs. So we think that the strong narrative towards nuclear will hold even regardless of the election outcome.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

This is the latest of a slew of tech companies who have been subject to regulatory overhand. RBC Capital Markets equity analyst Brad Erickson joins Catalysts to discuss why the regulatory challenges facing Big Tech companies should have little to no impact on investment strategies. Erickson explains that the Department of Justice is currently drafting a proposal for the judge in the default search case, outlining how they plan to \"remedy Google's ability to secure search status\" on smartphones. The DOJ has until December to submit this proposal, with the judge expected to rule by August 2025. However, Erickson notes that Google's planned appeal could extend the legal battle for several years. Due to this lengthy process, he believes Google's business \"isn't fundamentally about to change in sort of a seismic way,\" making the stock attractive at current levels. Addressing the broader regulatory landscape across the tech sector, Erickson states, \"Our kind of holistic view across the space, certainly for the companies we follow like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), and Meta (META) ... the businesses are so far down the road. The train has so far left the station that unwinding the technology and the intricacy and the complexity of what these companies have built to ... drive their businesses, I don't know if it's totally possible to unpack that.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Ten years in, Cornell has reinvented the company in many ways, experiencing the highs and lows of competing against other major retail giants like Walmart (WMT), Amazon (AMZN), and Costco (COST). To get an inside look at the veteran CEO\u2019s journey and his plans for the future, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sat down with Cornell at a Target store in Jersey City, NJ. The two also met at a park that played a major role in Cornell\u2019s upbringing in Queens, NY to explore what shaped him into the leader he is today. \u201cIf you grow up the way I did, you always feel like the underdog,\u201d says Cornell. This mindset helped Cornell rise the retail ranks. He has served in executive roles at major companies like Safeway and Sam\u2019s Club before running Target. Cornell took over when the retailer was struggling and coming off of a data breach. The CEO\u2019s first big move was to exit Canada, after the company\u2019s $5.4 billion venture north of the border failed to take off. In 2017 Cornell announced the $550 million acquisition of delivery company Shipt and a $7 billion investment in Target stores, at a time when the industry appeared to be shifting away from brick-and-mortar. These decisions paid off during the pandemic, when Target\u2019s revenue shot up past $100 billion for the first time in 2021. Recently, Target has missed the mark compared to competitors, with comparable sales falling for four straight quarters through the first quarter of 2024. Target\u2019s declining numbers were due to a number of factors, including retail theft, a backlash to Pride merchandise in 2023, and excess inventory resulting in price cuts, with the main driver being a slowdown in discretionary spending by consumers. Nearly 50% of Target\u2019s product portfolio is made up of non-essentials\u2014much higher than many competitors. To drive growth into the future, Cornell and Target are mixing strategies old and new. The company plans to invest in 300 stores over the next decade, continuing a trend under Cornell. In April of 2024 Target announced a paid membership program, Target Circle 360, to compete with Amazon Prime and Walmart+. The most recent numbers showed positive signs for the retailer, with sales up 2.7% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2024. Target is set to report third quarter earnings on November 20, where the company expects to see more growth, albeit at a slower rate.

Munoz points to Tesla (TSLA) as a good buy, explaining that the company's autonomous driving initiatives will be key to its next phase of growth. While other companies, like Waymo, are rolling out their own robotaxis, Munoz believes Tesla has a leg up on the competition as it has much more data to train its vehicles. However, he points to potential regulatory and policy risks down the line. He also highlights its improving financials, believing the company has \"a lot of cash to deliver on their product roadmap.\" He expects third quarter deliveries to come in between 460,000 and 470,000. Munoz notes that Tesla is \"not just a car company.\" He is bullish on its energy businesses, highlighting the \"explosive\" second quarter revenue growth. \"That's something that gets us excited away from just the selling of vehicles. And the auto industry has had some struggles over the last couple of years in this macro environment, but also with higher rates. So their diversified business lines and revenue there gets us very excited,\" he explains. Meanwhile, Munoz is bearish on Rivian (RIVN), telling Yahoo Finance, \"They need a lot of cash. This is a scale industry, and very recently, this summer, they partnered with Volkswagen (VWAGY). They got $5 billion to roll out the next phase of their growth, which is lower-cost vehicles. And so this is something that we're looking at. It's an unprofitable business. They lose money for every car that they make, and we're in an environment where consumers have preferences and there are options.\" In addition, Rivian is facing production challenges. Last month, the company paused the production of its electric delivery vehicles for Amazon (AMZN) \u2014one of its biggest customers. Munoz also notes that production declined last quarter, and while it appears as if the company will meet its targets, it's enough to make him feel \"uncomfortable.\" Finally, he argues that Rivian's offerings are not only narrow but too expensive relative to other EV players. Coupled with production challenges, he adds, \"They have to get these vehicles out to market to get sales to drive revenue, to hopefully become a profitable company. And they expect to do that by 2026. We don't know if they're going to make it.\" Munoz concludes, \"If they can lower their cost, if they can leverage their partnership with Volkswagen, and they can crank production up and get cars on the streets, I think that would be really positive for Rivian over the long run.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Over the majority of Cornell\u2019s tenure, Target has held its own against rivals Amazon (AMZN), Costco (COST), and Walmart (WMT). Cornell led the company to a revenue increase of nearly 50% from 2015 to 2022, peaking at over $109B as part of a pandemic-related spending surge. Since that peak, Target sales and profits have dipped due to a decline in discretionary spending among consumers, and other factors, including retail theft. In 2022 alone, inventory shrinkage, mostly in the form of retail theft, shaved off $700M from the company\u2019s profits. Following a wave of high-profile \u2018smash and grabs,\u2019 including several at Target stores, Target and other retailers have leaned in to increased security and technology to not only reduce and deter theft but to make stores safer and more accessible for customers. These efforts, along with government involvement, are already having an impact, according to Cornell. \u201cI feel so much better today than I did a year ago, and I think it comes back to support at the federal level, at the state level and at the local level,\u201d Cornell says. \u201cTo be clear, we do not like locking up product, but we like running stores and we want to keep our stores open. We want to make sure they're safe.\u201d For more of the full conversation with Cornell, tune into Yahoo Finance Live on Thursday, Sept. 26 at 10:30 a.m. ET.

Adam Kovacevich, Founder & CEO of Chamber of Progress, joins Morning Brief to discuss the growing tension within Big Tech. Kovacevich notes that Google is expanding in the cloud computing space, aiming to compete with industry leaders like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft. He explains that Google's focus on Microsoft stems from contractual terms that \"lock in customers and make it difficult for competitors to gain traction.\" However, he points out that this is \"not a new issue\" for Microsoft, nor is it the first time such concerns have been raised in the EU. \"This is a cold war that's gone hot between Google and Microsoft,\" Kovacevich told Yahoo Finance, noting that Microsoft has taken similar action against Google in the United States. He adds, \"I think one of the things you see here is Google punching back and saying 'look, Microsoft's contracts lock in cloud customers in the same way.'\" However, cloud computing does not have the same regulatory standards as other tech areas. \"This will be an interesting test of whether antitrust enforcers feel inclined to roll up their sleeves and take a closer look at the cloud computing market, which they haven't done to date,\" Kovacevich states.
