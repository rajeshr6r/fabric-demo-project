Durgesh Chopra, Evercore ISI managing director, joins Josh Schafer and Madison Mills on Market Domination to take a look at the energy sector. Chopra says \u201cthe single largest catalyst\u201d for independent power producers (IPPs) like Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vista Energy (VIST) is \u201cthe need for clean energy, 24/7 energy by these data centers.\u201d The analyst says reopening dormant nuclear plants is \u201cgoing to be the next big thing\u201d in energy. He notes,\u201d We have to be careful to balance this demand trend that we bring supply on time while also not disrupting the balance of residential customer builds. So I think that's a key challenge. But this is a good position for utilities to be in.\u201d For investors looking to get in on the AI-driven energy boom, Chopra says he doesn\u2019t think the utilities sector is currently overbought. \u201cSome of these IPPs may seem expensive on earnings, but there's a tremendous amount of EPS upside\u2026 I think there's more to go.\u201d He expects utilities to outperform the market led by the IPPs by the end of the quarter. Chopra adds that the opportunity in energy stocks is more long-term. \u201cThe reality is you build something new today, whether it's a gas plant, whether it's wind, solar storage, small modular reactors, all of these technologies are five to seven years build time\u2026 So these things are going to take some time. But they're all additive to earnings and should boost the long-term growth profile of the utility sector.\u201d For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

All three of the major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) opened lower on Thursday amid the latest labor market data and increasing Middle East tensions. Initial jobless claims for the week ending September 28 rose to 225,000, slightly above the estimated 221,000. Oil prices (CL=F, BZ=F) are continuing to spike as tensions boil between Israel and Iran. US stock markets are experiencing a period of heightened volatility, driven by a variety of factors including Hurricane Helene, the upcoming US presidential election, and escalating Middle East tensions. The Wealth Consulting Group's chief market strategist Talley L\u00e9ger acknowledges that markets have been hit by numerous events that could potentially unsettle investors, questioning, \"when are they perfectly certain?\" However, he notes that such turbulence is a common occurrence in financial markets, adding that \"through it all, the stock market has continued its inexorable march forward.\" Due to this dynamic, L\u00e9ger advises investors to view market dips as potential buying opportunities. The rotation out of Big Tech has become evident, with the standout \"Magnificent Seven\" (AAPL, TSLA, GOOG, GOOGL, AMZN, META, MSFT, NVDA) names no longer being the market frontrunners they once were. Roundhill Investments CEO Dave Mazza notes that the Magnificent Seven's market leadership \"hit an abrupt stop\" in mid-July, fueled by the unwinding of the yen carry trade. While Meta has been the only name to somewhat recover, Mazza believes \"it's too early to give up\" on the Magnificent Seven. Barton Crockett, Rosenblatt\u2019s senior research analyst, outlines his bullish stance on Meta. \u201cThe growth supports the multiple\u2026 The bigger backdrop, we think, is that people are getting more comfortable with Meta\u2019s strategic positioning. Their investments in AI have yielded improved returns on investment for marketers and better engagement from users, and they've kind of led and developed this direct marketing to kind of small- or mid-sized companies globally. This almost new niche that they've pioneered and owned.\u201d Crockett explains. The Hang Seng (^HSI) ended the day lower after 13 straight days of gains following a wave of stimulus measures aimed at bolstering the country's struggling economy. While JPMorgan has warned investors about the risks of chasing the rally given its high valuations, KraneShares CIO Brendan Ahern argues it's still in the \"very, very early innings.\" With more information about fiscal policy expected from Chinese officials, the rally could continue. He adds, \"Instead of looking through the rearview mirror, let's look through the windshield.\" This post was written by Melanie Riehl", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=86ebf03c6acd30f32d7e79542590f5db7a22117f1a84f4e8f67afe0746f58b7f"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1727978425, "headline": "Google Assures Employees It's Not About To Pull Off An Amazon On Them When It Comes To Work From Home", "id": 130204888, "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/benzinga_79/0a74b0834e9cbd85cf5a7091cfa3c567", "related": "GOOG", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Alphabet Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google has confirmed it will not follow Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strict return-to-office policy.

Jason Browne, Alexis Investment Partners president, joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss how recent volatility could be an opportunity to buy into tech. \u201cWe have a lot of negative news hitting simultaneous[ly] to the pullback. If we can look at those as opportunities to add to things that we may have missed out on or maybe underweight in that tends to work out well over time. The other thing to note is with tech, particularly [when] we're going into an environment that potentially is going to be continued growth but slower growth. Then names with very attractive balance sheets that are more consistent earners or earnings growers and so forth. They tend to be a place that people flock to,\u201d Browne tells the Market Domination team. He adds, \u201cWe are seeing this last couple of months consolidation period in this very strong uptrend, as overall a positive thing. We had lightened up on growth leading into this mostly because of wanting, like many, to take advantage of the broadening leadership associated with a more sustained rally. But we've been buying the dip in tech periodically in each of these pullbacks.\u201d The portfolio manager mentions Alexis Investment Partners \u201cused more indirect exposure than direct buying,\u201d with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) \u201cthat have significant weighting to these names.\u201d He names iShares Global 100 ETF (IOO.MX) and Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) as ways to play tech. Browne notes that the ETFs were \"within the context of also adding to things like\" [real estate investment trusts] REITs and the equal-weight S&P 500 (^SPXEW). \"I was kind of buying the dip today in general, but I specifically did make sure to incorporate some of these broadly diversified funds that are heavily weighted to large-cap tech as a big chunk.\u201d Browne also has focused on \"standouts within leading sectors.\" He says \"Within technology, we own, as you might imagine, Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), in addition to owning a semiconductor ETF.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.
