At the time Barra took over as CEO, General Motors was still emerging from its 2009 bankruptcy and reeling from an ignition switch recall that led to over one hundred fatalities. Barra was tasked with completely overhauling GM's siloed culture and changing how the public viewed the company\u2019s cars, as well as regaining their trust. \"A crisis is the time you really demonstrate to the entire team that you're going to live your values,\" Barra told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi in a recent exclusive sit-down interview -- as well as a spin in the newly designed E-Ray Corvette on GM\u2019s technical campus in Michigan. Barra shares with Yahoo Finance how she has led GM through crises, as she did when she took over the helm, as well as how she intends to make good on her bets to become the leader of electric and autonomous vehicles despite stiff competition from Tesla (TLSA) and skepticism from shareholders.

At the time Barra took over as CEO, GM was still emerging from its 2009 bankruptcy and reeling from an ignition switch recall that led to over one hundred fatalities. Barra was tasked with completely changing GM's siloed culture and changing how the public viewed the company\u2019s cars, as well as regaining their trust, which she eventually did. Now, contrary to other automakers who are scaling back their immediate plans to convert their car and truck lineups to all-electric in response to slowing consumer demand, she is at it again, this time with GM shareholders. Yahoo Finance\u2019s Executive Editor Brian Sozzi got the rare opportunity to sit shotgun with Barra in the newly designed E-Ray Corvette on GM\u2019s technical campus in Michigan to hear what Barra believes are the most important things the company needs to focus on to win over investors. As well as how she intends to make good on her bets to become the leader of electric and autonomous vehicles despite stiff competition from Tesla (TLSA) and skepticism from shareholders.

At the time Barra took over as CEO, General Motors was still emerging from its 2009 bankruptcy and reeling from an ignition switch recall that led to over one hundred fatalities. Barra was tasked with completely changing GM's siloed culture and simultaneously changing how the public viewed the company\u2019s cars, as well as regaining their trust. And now she's looking to take GM into a future that she believes includes cars and trucks that run on batteries. Yahoo Finance got the rare opportunity to sit shotgun with Barra in the newly designed E-Ray Corvette to hear how the change-maker CEO intends to make good on her bets to become the leader of electric and autonomous vehicles, despite stiff competition from Tesla (TLSA) and skepticism from shareholders.

The series gives consumers and investors an inside look into the innovative thinking and diverse life experiences of some of the biggest players in business to find out how they lead through change, and how they define success for themselves and their organizations.
