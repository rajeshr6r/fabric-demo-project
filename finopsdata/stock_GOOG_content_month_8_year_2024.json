As rates start to ease, he believes that \"high-margin monopolistic type businesses that have really strong tailwinds\" are poised to benefit. He specifically points to the tech sector and names like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) as examples.

In the latest edition of Good Buy or Goodbye, Spear Invest Founder and Chief Investment Officer Ivana Delevska shares which she thinks is worth buying and which one investors may want to avoid. Delevska says Nvidia is the stock to buy. She thinks the cycle for the company's Hopper line has been stronger than expected and that its upcoming Blackwell line is selling well. Delevska also notes that companies aren't just updating old systems but creating new ones for their AI products, which benefits Nvidia. Alphabet is the stock Delevska says investors may want to say goodbye to. She argues that its search business is \"under attack\" from AI and that overall AI competition is heating up. She also thinks the antitrust concerns will continue to weigh on the company's current businesses as well as potentially hamper the tech giant's ability to expand via acquisitions.\u00a0 For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.
