Tom Narayan, RBC Capital Markets lead equity analyst of global autos, sits down with Market Domination Hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to dig into Tesla's (TSLA) delivery numbers and where the company stands going forward. Narayan outlines his view that Tesla\u2019s subpar auto sales don\u2019t actually matter, explaining that the \u201ccar business for me is less, like 5% of my [Tesla] valuation. They need to sell cars to sell [full self-driving] FSD and everything else. But I think folks are going to start looking at the bottom line more on gross profit. You're going to have regulatory credits, which surprised a lot of people last quarter. It's going to be good this quarter again and next year. And energy storage, people are finally talking about this. We saw the number that they printed today wasn't as good as last quarter, but way bigger than the run rate of last year. So I think folks are going to stop looking at the delivery numbers so carefully. And start looking at gross profit. And it's going to look pretty good.\u201d He says the highly-anticipated robotaxi is \u201chalf of my entire valuation, as you know. I'm a big believer in the robotaxi concept. The difference, though, between this event and what they held in the Power Day a few years ago, where the stock was up quite a bit, is Power Day was more real now, whereas I think robotaxis are a little bit farther away. That's why I think it might be difficult to get crazy excited, at least a stock to react the way it will be. I think it did into it, but I do think you'll get a lot of people like me writing big reports finally with real numbers and putting it in their models. That might help. But again, this is far into the future, so I just don't know how much it's going to impact.\u201d The long horizon for Tesla\u2019s robotaxi isn\u2019t a tech issue but rather a regulatory issue. \u201cWe all saw what happened with GM Cruise having to pull away and now starting to tip their toe back in. Cities are going to have to completely re-engineer themselves\u2026 It's a very human-driven thing, let's put it that way. You're making decisions all the time. And so it's going to take a while for regulators to be okay with that.\u201d The analyst offers his perspective on the Cybertruck and the model's role in the Tesla brand. \u201cI don't think it's a real game-changer. If anything, they're losing money on it, but it is trying to get excitement back into the brand, which maybe they lost a little compared to where they were. But really, ultimately, this is a halo car that hopefully lifts their brand.\u201d For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.

Traders flocked to more defensive areas of the market in Tuesday's trading session after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel. Israel has vowed to respond to the attack, raising concerns about tensions in the Middle East escalating even further. Raymond James Washington policy analyst and managing director Ed Mills observes that markets have been \"shockingly resilient\" despite global unrest. \"There are a lot of unknowns ahead and Israel will absolutely respond. They cannot let hundreds of missiles going towards their country be met without a response,\" Mills states. However, he notes that the nature of Israel's response remains \"uncertain.\" US private payroll numbers beat Wall Street expectations in September, according to the latest ADP report. The data shows that 143,000 jobs were added in the private sector last month, surpassing the projected 125,000 jobs \u2014 a significant increase from August's reported 99,000 jobs. Tesla (TSLA) shares are under pressure after the company reported that it delivered 462,890 vehicles during the third quarter. This figure came in slightly below Wall Street's expectation of 463,897 deliveries. William Blair group head of energy and sustainability research sector, Jed Dorsheimer, notes that the growing optimism in delivery estimates on Wall Street was closely tied to Tesla's rising stock price. Consequently, he says, \"it's not surprising to see a pullback\" now that the numbers have missed expectations. Despite this setback, Dorsheimer points out that this quarter demonstrates Tesla's stabilization ahead of \"some key catalysts\" for the business, including the upcoming robotaxi event and the Shanghai energy business. Nike (NKE) is looking for a fresh start under its incoming CEO, Elliott Hill. The footwear giant reported mixed fiscal first quarter results, withdrew its full-year sales guidance, and postponed its investor day that was originally scheduled for November. Hill will step into the role on October 14, where he will embark on a turnaround mission for the company. Baird Senior Research Analyst Jonathan Komp argues that under Hill, Nike will likely be able to improve its performance, saying, \"Generally, we expect stocks in the sector to bottom when earnings start getting less bad. We think we've seen the worst here for Nike, but it is going to take patience.\" As the Federal Reserve's rate easing cycle is underway, Megan Horneman, Verdence Capital Advisors CIO, believes that investors are putting too much faith in a soft landing. She tells Yahoo Finance, \"People are just getting a little ahead of themselves as far as what strength there is in the economy.\" While the labor market remains \"relatively strong,\" she has concerns about the consumer, noting that credit card debt is over $1 trillion. She adds, \"We know that inflation is coming down towards the Fed's target, but we can't forget that this has been accumulating for several years now. So this is really a strain on consumers... I just don't see the strength in the consumer that's going to be able to last much longer.\" This post was written by Melanie Riehl", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=6fd8d89dff2d3323a052a38f20d53ecd9c6fb67a533eab8046a7913d31426955"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1727892455, "headline": "Why Tesla (TSLA) Stock Is Trading Lower Today", "id": 130193602, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kyEm5VU.Mu13_2MAnTOwQw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/stockstory_922/9e0f08f01f3d35996ac49bdd618e9411", "related": "TSLA", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "Shares of electric vehicle pioneer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) fell 6.1% in the morning session after the company reported Q3 2024 electric vehicle (EV) deliveries of 462,890, below analysts' estimates.

Oppenheimer Head of Technical Analysis Ari Wald joins Catalysts to discuss this outlook. Wald emphasizes that the key positive for markets is that market breadth \"remains firm,\" supporting higher highs throughout the end of 2024. Based on this, he believes \"the bull cycle is intact,\" with the market positioned for continued growth into 2025. He advises buying higher growth companies, explaining, \"The scarcity premium comes back against a lower growth backdrop for these names,\" especially within the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC). Wald elaborates on the Nasdaq's potential: \"It has underperformed since the summer, but I think through this rotational nature it is set up to lead again. It did a good job holding up support levels and so for that reason, for us, it's growth for the long-term. I think this is a growth and tech-led secular bull, and then on a near-term basis, it's become tactically attractive to buy that style as well.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Dorsheimer notes that the growing optimism in delivery estimates on Wall Street was closely tied to Tesla's rising stock price. Consequently, he says, \"it's not surprising to see a pullback\" now that the numbers have missed expectations. Despite this setback, Dorsheimer points out that this quarter demonstrates Tesla's stabilization ahead of \"some key catalysts\" for the business, including the upcoming robotaxi event and the Shanghai energy business. Importantly, Dorsheimer emphasizes the significance of Tesla's energy business and its potential impact on the company's future growth. He states, \"Our grids are stressed to the max right now and that's a global statement.
