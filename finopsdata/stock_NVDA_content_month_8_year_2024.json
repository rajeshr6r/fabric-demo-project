CFRA Research senior equity analyst Angelo Zino joins Market Domination to give insight into the chip sector and how some of these chip makers may fare amidst high demand moving forward. Zino states that when you look at Marvell's non-AI business segments \"like carrier infrastructure, the consumer side of things, those enterprise networking, those businesses have declined 50 to 70% over the last two to three quarters.\" \"Our view is kind of the inventory correction is kind of really played itself out at this point in time. And you're now looking at potential sequential improvement here in the July quarter and, more importantly, in the following 2 to 3 quarters,\" Zino tells Yahoo Finance. Broadcom is set to report its fiscal third quarter results next week on Thursday, September 5. Zino finds Broadcom's networking business to be \"the bread and butter\" for their semiconductor segments. \"We think that is kind of running on all cylinders. So as far as kind of the semiconductor business, AI is driving that business very well, as well as Apple (AAPL). And then the VMware side of things, they continue to exceed our expectations on both the cost-cutting side of things, as well as kind of the revenue growth trajectory,\" Zino says.

Investors may be trying to understand where this slide comes from despite all the hype around AI. Tusk Venture Partners Founder And CEO Bradley Tusk joins Market Domination Overtime to give insight into Nvidia's earnings, the AI sector, and the potential for OpenAI's next round of funding. In terms of why Nvidia shares have been sliding, despite a positive Q2 performance, Tusk says: \"Really it's sort of I think speaks to a slightly broader concern, which is at the back of investors minds. They're starting to wonder like, 'hey, are we over inflating this? Is it going too far?' Because they couldn't have really done any better than they did. It's unreasonable. Like 'it's your fault.' It's not their fault. It's a question of are they overvalued and that's collectively our fault, right? \" With the Wall Street Journal reporting that Nvidia is in talks about investing in OpenAI, Tusk comments: \"What's the strategic value for you in having a role with OpenAI? What they all might say is, look, we want a seat at the table. 'We want to know what they're up to. We don't want all of a sudden, Microsoft taking this thing going off in a totally different direction, that we can't compete with.'\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.

And listen, at the end of the day, this is a company that beat their numbers. Probably on the data center side we call it about a $1.5 billion or so.

I mean, you had this beat of expectations on the Nvidia side. It's still fairly good news for the future there. But it wasn't quite as good as investors hoped.

As rates start to ease, he believes that \"high-margin monopolistic type businesses that have really strong tailwinds\" are poised to benefit. He specifically points to the tech sector and names like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Nvidia (NVDA) as examples.

Kindig characterizes Nvidia's report as \"great,\" noting that projections for the company continue to be revised upward, never downward. While Nvidia did mention delays with shipments of its Blackwell GPU, Kindig states this \"is not a concern; if anything, it's extremely bullish.\" She explains that Nvidia is in the midst of a product cycle, and when the Blackwell GPU chips begin shipping, it will be \"absolute, ultimate fireworks\" for the company. \"It's important to understand that there's a shipping cycle that occurs for this company. Some media outlets have blown that out of proportion,\" Kindig tells Yahoo Finance. She adds: \"Early next year will be fireworks again for Nvidia, and we will be on track for that $10 trillion [valuation].\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.

Is this a sign of investor enthusiasm waning or is this a small bump on the road to a new record height? S&P Global Ratings technology director Andrew Chang joins Catalysts to give insight into Nvidia's recent earnings report and the current enthusiasm for the AI sector from investors. For his view over Nvidia, Chang explains his AA- credit rating: \"The credit rating's AA- with a stable outlook. We upgraded the company back in April. And to put it plainly, Nvidia is the highest-rated semiconductor company globally, along with TSMC (TSM)... and Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) in Korea. So the highest rating from the semi perspective We really like the tech lead that the company has and the strong product execution, thus far.\" Chang outlines what could be a risk from a credit perspective: \"The potential for short-term swings in demand despite the long-term massive growth potential. So this is not going to be an up and to the right every quarter. Hyperscalers, as you mentioned, they can't spend fast enough. But if the ROI on their investments aren't up to par, you could easily see Amazon's and Microsoft's pausing purchases for multiple quarters. They've done that before with general servers, so they could clearly do that with AI servers.\" He continues on with: \"And when that day comes... I could see a scenario where the hyperscale spending declines meaningfully and that could cause some panic among investors. But we have to remember that this is a long-term growth story, that we should not be so fixated on short-term swings. \" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.
