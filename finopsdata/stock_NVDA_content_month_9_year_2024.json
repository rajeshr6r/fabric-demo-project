As Wall Street opens for the final trading day of the week, Yahoo Finance Markets & Data editor Jared Blikre analyzes the top market trends, including the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 42nd record high and the weakening of the US dollar against the Japanese yen. August's Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) data \u2014 the Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation \u2014 came in line with economist expectations. The headline PCE figure showed a modest month-over-month increase of 0.1%, while rising by 2.2% year-over-year. Core PCE, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased by 2.7% compared to the same period last year. Tiffany Wilding, PIMCO managing director and economist, explains, \"Overall, today's data was sort of broadly in line with expectations\u2026 We've come on a string of pretty good inflation readings over the last several months and that was coming after an acceleration in inflation in the first quarter. So I think Fed officials are pretty feeling pretty good about where inflation is sitting,\u201d Wilding tells Yahoo Finance. Blake Gwinn, RBC Capital Markets head of US rates strategy, breaks down what he expects from the Federal Reserve after the first rate cut. He tells Yahoo Finance, \u201cThere are some upside risks around inflation, and if you look at our forecast for where the Fed is going to cut to our terminal rate, it's much higher than markets are expecting. We're at 4% to 4.25%. Markets are pricing much lower than that. The Fed's dots are much lower than that.\u201d Shares of Costco (COST) are sliding after the retailer posted a mixed fourth-quarter earnings report. Revenue came in at $79.70 billion, falling slightly below the expected $79.96 billion. Meanwhile, US comparable sales, ex-gasoline and currency impacts, were better than analysts were expecting. Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst Bill Kirk believes that Costco's stock is \"priced nearly for perfection,\" telling Yahoo Finance, \"It's universally loved, it's operating extremely well, and the valuation and where it trades reflects that.\" While the stock is under a bit of pressure following the earnings report, he explains, \"Any little pause in momentum, any little hiccup in margin is accentuated when you have a valuation that high.\" Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) are reversing some gains after closing higher for four consecutive days. Radio Free Mobile Founder Richard Windsor emphasizes that Nvidia's continued growth \"depends on the overall macro.\" For investors looking to enter the AI trade, he states that Nvidia is \"the lowest risk way\" to do so. However, he notes that investors must consider the broader market direction. Due to Nvidia stock's nature, Windsor explains that if markets sell off, Nvidia will fall significantly, adding, \"Consequently, I think it's [Nvidia stock] going to go back and forth, I suspect in line or amplify the signal of the market rather than anything specific to Nvidia.\" This post was written by Melanie Riehl", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=84c2ec07db35ee1b4410378712c335d8f079a88e13eac171a64a4f6def9d3021"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1727459871, "headline": "Dow Jones Fades; Nvidia Falls As Trump Media Jumps After Co-Founder Sells Stake (Live Coverage)", "id": 130105300, "image": "https://media.zenfs.com/en/ibd.com/45e589cf57b3451603fbe0c30c124ed6", "related": "NVDA", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "The Dow Jones and Russell 2000 outperformed on the stock market today after the latest reading on inflation didn't sound any alarms.", "url": "https://finnhub.io/api/news?id=7e980e3ab8ab891d132e9a2f24b6d1cd05cd731a079e8713012f9da682dbff10"}, {"category": "company", "datetime": 1727457024, "headline": "Nvidia\u2019s Huang Says Nuclear Power an Option to Feed Data Centers", "id": 130106560, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/yk6PHHDFYVcw4qZyg7PGoA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDE-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_technology_68/7d5df8fdf39a8db1221a0633fbf540ec", "related": "NVDA", "source": "Yahoo", "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.

Michael Darda, Roth Capital Partners chief economist and macro strategist tells Yahoo Finance, \u201cIf you look at first-time claims in isolation, it really doesn't look like there's anything wrong with this labor market whatsoever. Unfortunately, that is not the whole story.\u201d The latest labor market differential report, which shows the difference between the share of consumers who view jobs as \u201cplentiful\u201d compared to those who view jobs as \u201chard to get,\u201d fell to its lowest reading since March 2021. Darda says the recent decline in the labor market differential \u201cwould be consistent with the unemployment rate continuing to creep [up], eventually towards 5% and that would throw us back into the recession alarm bell camp.\u201d Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI) are plummeting after a report from the Wall Street Journal revealed that the Department of Justice is investigating the company over alleged accounting irregularities. On the other hand, chip stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Intel (INTC) are rising in sympathy with Micron (MU) after it issued strong first quarter guidance. A new report from Bain & Company forecasts substantial growth in the AI product market in the coming years. The firm projects that the market for AI-related hardware and software could expand by 40-50% annually, reaching approximately $990 billion by 2027. Bain & Company global technology and cloud services practice chairman David Crawford sees three \"broad pockets of growth\" for AI. First, large hyperscalers building out their capabilities are generating \"enormous\" demand. The second pocket for growth lies in enterprise adoption. The third growth area will likely be seen in independent software vendors that build AI capabilities for their products and run them in their own data centers. As the streaming wars heat up, Macquarie US equity research senior media tech analyst Tim Nollen remains Neutral on one of the biggest players: Disney (DIS). Nollen explains that there are several areas that will \"hit Disney's PNL (profit and loss) balance sheet and cash flows over the next couple of years.\" However, ESPN direct-to-consumer will be the biggest factor. He calls this \"the largest event in the streaming landscape\" since the launch of Disney+, and believes that offering ESPN direct-to-consumer will likely cause cord-cutting to accelerate. Yet, he remains Neutral on the company until there are clearer projections about the success of ESPN direct-to-consumer.
