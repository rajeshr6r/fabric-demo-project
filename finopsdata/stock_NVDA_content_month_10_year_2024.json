Jason Browne, Alexis Investment Partners president, joins Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton on Market Domination to discuss how recent volatility could be an opportunity to buy into tech. \u201cWe have a lot of negative news hitting simultaneous[ly] to the pullback. If we can look at those as opportunities to add to things that we may have missed out on or maybe underweight in that tends to work out well over time. The other thing to note is with tech, particularly [when] we're going into an environment that potentially is going to be continued growth but slower growth. Then names with very attractive balance sheets that are more consistent earners or earnings growers and so forth. They tend to be a place that people flock to,\u201d Browne tells the Market Domination team. He adds, \u201cWe are seeing this last couple of months consolidation period in this very strong uptrend, as overall a positive thing. We had lightened up on growth leading into this mostly because of wanting, like many, to take advantage of the broadening leadership associated with a more sustained rally. But we've been buying the dip in tech periodically in each of these pullbacks.\u201d The portfolio manager mentions Alexis Investment Partners \u201cused more indirect exposure than direct buying,\u201d with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) \u201cthat have significant weighting to these names.\u201d He names iShares Global 100 ETF (IOO.MX) and Vanguard Growth ETF (VUG) as ways to play tech. Browne notes that the ETFs were \"within the context of also adding to things like\" [real estate investment trusts] REITs and the equal-weight S&P 500 (^SPXEW). \"I was kind of buying the dip today in general, but I specifically did make sure to incorporate some of these broadly diversified funds that are heavily weighted to large-cap tech as a big chunk.\u201d Browne also has focused on \"standouts within leading sectors.\" He says \"Within technology, we own, as you might imagine, Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), in addition to owning a semiconductor ETF.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.
