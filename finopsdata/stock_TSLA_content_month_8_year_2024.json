I mean, the variability is creating havoc within the system... prices were up 833% year over year.

He sees Tesla (TSLA), with its Tesla Energy unit, and GE Vernova as good AI plays as they meet the energy solution of the equation. \"If you don't have energy that increases, then your AI play will not work because large language models require, on average, 200 times more energy per search than traditional search and crypto,\" he explains.
