Google came out after that, and remember, Meta went down 11%, and Google initiated a dividend, which was great, but if you look at the forward numbers, actually, the estimates across the Street actually edged down for revenues for their upcoming June quarter as well. So, I think to some extent, Google benefitted from Meta going first, and if you look at Microsoft, sort of a similar situation, where the stock was up, I think, 2% or so the next day, but again, they came after Meta, and Microsoft's forward revenue numbers edged down slightly as well,\" Niles explained.

Feeney notes that earnings results from Big Tech names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META) have enabled the markets to sustain their upward momentum despite a Federal Reserve rate cut not yet materializing. Many of these companies are \"on track to grow\" on the back of the ongoing artificial intelligence boom, she adds.\u00a0 Feeney acknowledges that \"there's a lot of mixed information coming out of the markets,\" emphasizing the importance of investing in individual stocks instead of taking a broad approach. Although the Fed hasn't cut rates, she describes it as a \"good news story\" because the economy remains strong, and earnings continue to grow. \"What you have to do is not look at the market as a whole, but look at individual companies with strong demand drivers that are in the right place in the market for how the world is changing,\" Feeney tells Yahoo Finance.

The big takeaway from both reports? That generative artificial intelligence is here and companies are spending on it, says both Baird Technology Desk Sector Strategist Ted Mortonson and RBC Capital Markets Software Equity Analyst Rishi Jaluria. \"The commentary out of both Google and Microsoft, I think, tells us that there is real demand for AI... there's actual money being put behind this. It's not just hype. It's not just people talking about it. There's actual capital being put to work,\" Jaluria tells Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. Mortonson agrees. \"We are going through, really, a generational infrastructure build,\" Mortonson says, adding that both Microsoft and Alphabet have an \"advantage\" because their \"data center footprint already exists.\" Jaluria notes that investors \"will be patient\" with Microsoft's big spending on infrastructure as long as the company's AI-related businesses continue to show growth. As to why investors were less happy about Meta's (META) AI spending, Mortonson thinks it may come down to \"a game of positioning.\" \"Meta was extremely crowded going into the print. There's some people that, quite frankly, didn't like some of the unprofitable spend,\" Mortonson says. He believes that Meta is \"very attractive\" given how hard the stock was hit by its results, but the Microsoft does have a \"huge advantage\" due to its enterprise business.
