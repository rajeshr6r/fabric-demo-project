He notes the Magnificent Seven valuations have diverged \"drastically,\" causing investors to \"differentiate\" between them rather than treat them as a uniform group. As growth moderates for these mega-cap stocks, O'Rourke expects \"rotation\" within the Magnificent Seven tech companies as investors compare valuations and future trajectories. He believes this could force funds into other promising areas of the market beyond the narrow mega-cap technology focus, like biotech and pharma.
