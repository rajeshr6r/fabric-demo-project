Stone observes a \"rotation narrative\" in the markets, where the Magnificent Seven stocks' valuations are considered too lofty, making it \"very hard to hit\" expectations. As this trend continues, he suggests investors may reduce their positions in these stocks and look elsewhere in the broader market for attractive opportunities. \"Investors are growing a little bit impatient that we're kicking the can down the road,\" Stone notes, referring to Big Tech names as investors wait for AI investments to yield returns. He cautions, \"all of this CapEx [capital expenditures] is great today, but if you don't have a customer base to execute on in a year from now, or if that customer base declines from worsening economic scenarios, you're going to run into issues down the road.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.

Smith notes, \"It's a data-intensive point in the season,\" with earnings reports and Federal Reserve decisions all scheduled for this week. However, following lackluster reports from companies like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA) last week, Smith observes that \"there's very little appetite for companies that miss earnings,\" especially in the technology sector, which explains the massive sell-offs markets have seen. Regarding AI investments by Big Tech companies, Smith explains to Yahoo Finance, \"I think... AI is important to all of the Magnificent 7 in different ways, so to paint them all with the same brush is a little bit risky.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Catalysts.
