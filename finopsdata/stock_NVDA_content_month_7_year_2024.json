Moor Insights & Strategy Founder, CEO, and chief analyst Patrick Moorhead joins Asking For A Trade to give insight into the tech sector, the AI trade, and what it means for Big Tech moving forward into the earnings season. Moorhead reiterates his thought from a previous interview: \"I really laid out a thesis that says the infrastructure build-out is going to continue for at least another year and maybe 18 months, and that's driven primarily by the downstream FOMO, or the fear of missing out, from those enterprise SaaS providers. Meta, who clearly showed that they're investing hardcore because they have to. If you are not investing in your competitors, you could be set back potentially a decade here. Moorhead is also looking at the long-term valuations of AI-adjacent software companies and chip designers like ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Arm Holdings (ARM) He ends with his thoughts that Nvidia (NVDA) has \"at least another 12 months to run. We saw TSMC (TSM), where Nvidia does all of their manufacturing, they're basically sold out through 2025 and into 2026. We just heard from Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta that that they're putting the pedal to the metal on this.

VanCronkhite explains that though the AI trade has fueled the market gains, right now, the developments aren't really showing up in quarterly results, leaving some investors questioning when it will happen. In terms of the tech sector, and the rotation into small caps that has been seen in markets the last few weeks, VanCronkhite states: \"I've been calling for this value rotation going back a couple of weeks now, and it's starting to play out well. There could be more legs to this, and it makes a lot of sense. With the amount of money being concentrated in a narrow market, we only get there for one of two reasons. We either get there because of greed or exuberance, which we have today around the AI trade, or you get there out of fear. When you're worried about the overall economy, maybe the Fed being late to react, pushing us into a recession, you want to get more and more capital around a fewer and fewer set of companies where you have the most visibility.\" He continues with: \"So both fear and greed have pushed capital into a narrow market, but those will both get resolved eventually. And I think that the cool inflation prints is giving the market the belief the Fed can begin to act, giving them the chance to jump through that ever closing window to avoid a recession. And as that happens, the natural rotation is out of the concentrate names into the value trade into the broader markets.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Wealth!
