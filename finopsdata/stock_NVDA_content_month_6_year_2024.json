Newton believes there are \"a lot of reasons to be constructive about the market,\" going on to explain: \"We're heading into a very bullish time of seasonality in election years. July tends to be very, very good, similar to June. I think a lot of investors remain worried about geopolitical risk, about political risk and the fear of growth slowdowns. But the bottom line is, technically, we have over 70% of all Russell 3000 (^RUA) stocks above their 200-day moving averages. That's actually a much healthier sign.\" He also anticipates rates will fall along with the dollar: \"I do sense that the data is going to continue to get weaker along the fringes. Inflation should start to fall like a rock. So despite the fact that gas (RB=F) and food prices are high for everybody, you have been seeing some evidence of broad-based inflation starting to come down. And I think that's going to be encouraging, not because a weak economy means stocks are good, more that the Fed's rate cut view will come back into line. And we'll have a little bit more clarity as to when they start cutting rates.\" For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination Overtime.
